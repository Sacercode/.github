# 🙋‍♀️ Welcome, internet user !

Project founder here. Please, let me explain it.

EditIDE is a product made by web creators, for web creators.

My goal is to create a all-in one web application, to create others web applications.

Unless others CMS, web-builders, and no-code tools, EditIDE is meant to visualize whole projects easiers, without hidding the real code within.

I want every web project's actors to be able to quickly find what they need to work.
