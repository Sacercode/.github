# 🙋‍♀️ Welcome, internet user !

Project founder here. Please, let me explain it.

EditIDE is a product made by web creators, for web creators.

My goal is to create a all-in one web application, to create others web applications.

Unless others CMS, web-builders, and no-code tools, EditIDE is meant to visualize whole projects easiers, without hidding the real code within.

I want every web project's actors to be able to quickly find what they need to work on.

You can install some of the projects made and used for EditIDE using your favorite package manager. I made them available on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/~edocode.fr)
